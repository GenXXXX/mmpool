# Costs

## Cost per entry
There is some cost per entry associated with rewards consensus. This depends on the implementation:
- Multi-sig wallet
  - Transaction fees for submitting rewards
- Predetermined or Entrants Voting 
  - Transaction fees per bracket per voter

## Cost per bracket
**Scorers** need to be compensated somehow for their work. They have some cost per bracket for their work, along with profit needed to incentivize Scorers.
